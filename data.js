I’ve been running for about three years and joined running club at the beginning of my second year. I love running because it’s a great stress reliever for me and joined running club as it was a great way for me to meet people starting my second year of college as my first year was completely online due to the COVID-19 pandemic. Outside of running, I like playing other sports such as soccer and basketball. I can’t wait to meet you all and go for a run!"
